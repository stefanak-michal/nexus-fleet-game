# Nexus Fleet

Dive into Nexus Fleet, a thrilling roguelike twist on classic Sea Battle! Command a starting fleet and engage in turn-based naval combat. Sink enemy ships to earn rewards: new vessels and powerful Admirals with unique abilities! Choose wisely as you can lead up to 3 Admirals, each offering strategic advantages. Survive as many battles as you can, but beware - defeat means starting anew with a fresh fleet. Can you conquer the ever-challenging seas?
